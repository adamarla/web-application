# The next 3 directives will ignore all generated .tex, .dvi, .ps, .pdf etc.
# They work because we name generated files in a specific way in the Makefiles
math-*
physics-*
chemistry-*

# represent extensions that are rather commonly used by users when 
# doing stuff on the command line

*.log 
*.aux
*.out

# There is no need to track .table files generated from .gnuplot
*.table
