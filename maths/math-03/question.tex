    Look at at it this way. 
    $x^3-ax+b = (x-1)\cdot (x-2) \times\texttt{(something)}$.
    Irrespective of what \texttt{(something)} is,\, substituting 
    either $x=1$ or $x=2$ will turn $x^3-ax+b = 0$

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]

  If $(x-1)$ and $(x-2)$ are factors of $x^3-ax+b$,\, 
  then for $x=1$ and $x=2$,\,$x^3-ax+b = 0$

  \begin{align}
    \Rightarrow & \underbrace{1-a+b = 0}_{\texttt{$x=1$}} \\ 
                & \underbrace{8-2a+b = 0}_{\texttt{$x=2$}}
  \end{align} 

  Solving the above equations for $a$ and $b$ gives, 

  \begin{align}
    a &= 7 \\
    b &= 6
  \end{align} 

  Here is another way of solving the same question
  \setcounter{equation}{0}
  \begin{align}
    x^3-ax+b &= \overbrace{(x-1)\cdot(x-2)}^{\texttt{known factors}}
                \cdot\overbrace{(x-g)}^{\texttt{unknown factor}} \\
             &= (x^2-3x+2)\cdot(x-g) \\ 
             &= x^3-gx^2-3x^2+3xg+2x-2g \\
             &= x^3-(g+3)x^2+(3g+2)x-2g 
  \end{align} 

  Comparing coefficients of powers of $x$ and the constant on both sides, we get
  \begin{align} 
    g+3 = 0 &\Rightarrow g = -3 \\ 
    -a = 3g + 2 &\Rightarrow a = 7 \\ 
    b = -2g &\Rightarrow b = 6
  \end{align} 

  The equation therefore is $x^3-7x+6$ and its factors are $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$ 
  and $(x+3)$
\end{solution}

      In some ways, the second method is a better solution
      because you not only learn what $a$ and $b$ are,
      you also learn what the third factor is - even though finding 
      the third factor was not part of the question. But it could have been
