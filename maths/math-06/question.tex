\question[5] Two real numbers $x$ and $y$ are chosen from the intervals
$x\in [0,2]$ and $y\in [0,2]$. What is the probability that $x^2+y^2\leq 1$?

\begin{solution}[\halfpage]
  In the figure alongside, the $(x,y)$ that satisfy the conditions
  $x\in [0,2]$ and $y\in [0,2]$ lie within the square whose area is $A_2$

  Similarly, the $(x,y)$ that satisfy $x^2+y^2\leq 1$ lie within the circle.

  The only $(x,y)$ that satisfy both the above conditions are therefore
  those that lie within $A_1$.

  Hence, the required probability is given by, 
  \begin{align}
     P &= \dfrac{A_1}{A_2} \\
     &= \dfrac{\frac{\pi R^2}{4}}{2\times 2} \\ 
     &= \dfrac{\pi}{16} 
  \end{align} 
\end{solution}
