Listed below are class atributes used in HAML files here
and the meaning of those attributes : 

1. in-line-forms : For forms that are rendered within some other form. 
                   Applied to the <form> element that will be inlined

2. extractable : Marks the beginning of the sub-tree that can be extracted 
                 out from its parent and appended someplace else

3. new-entity : Marks any HTML node - usually <form> - that is used for 
                collecting input to create a new record in the DB

4. narrow : For elements that are to be rendered with width = 1/3 of parent 
5. pane : Marks elements that are rendered as independent and persistent 
          "control panels" on a page

6. appendable : The reverse of extractable. Marks the point in the DOM 
                below which HTML sub-trees can be added 

7. stub : The HTML sub-tree that is added within an appendable. Always
          a child of an 'appendable' and always the parent of whatever new 
          HTML is added. Must have an attribute called 'index'

8. cloneable : Similar to an 'extractable'. Only difference is that a 'cloneable' 
               must be, well, cloned before it can be pasted as a 'stub' within
               an appendable
