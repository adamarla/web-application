      A new section has been created and will be listed here.
      Also shown is the <b>unique code</b> - written in <b>orange</b> - that is given to each section
    %p
      <b>Give this code to all students you want in this section</b>. Students will log into 
      their Gradians.com account, enter this code and <b>enroll themselves</b> into this section

      A student can belong to more than one section. She could, for example, belong to a 
      section called 11-A and another section called Gifted Students 
    %p
      The point is that a section is nothing more than a group of students. And you can 
      group your students in any which way you want
