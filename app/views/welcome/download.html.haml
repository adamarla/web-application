      'Scanbot' is a downloadable application that will detect, collate and then 
      transmit testpaper scans stored on your computer.  All you need to do is tell 
      the scanbot which folder/directory the scans are in and it will do the rest

        Your browser will pop-up a message asking you to confirm whether or not you want
        to download this application. This is expected and is - in fact - desirable behaviour.
        And for the scanbot, you can safely click on 'OK' or 'Accept'

      The program will be available under <b>Start > All Programs</b> of your <b>Windows</b> machine. 
      Start the application and it will begin looking for scans. Once found, it will transmit them. 
      You can leave Scanbot running in the background. It will check periodically for new scans on your machine
