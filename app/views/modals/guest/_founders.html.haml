      %div
        A graduate of UCLA's Anderson School of Management, Abhinav first 
        realized the need for Gradians.com while grading papers for his 
        statistics professor. It occurred to him that if the teachers  
        had to do this themselves, they could not do it very often.
        This was the genesis of the idea.
      %div
        Prior to this Abhinav worked in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) 
        industry, developing software design tools for semiconductor firms. 
        His first computer was Sinclair's ZX Spectrum. He is still holding on to it, 
        even though he now programs on his laptop.
