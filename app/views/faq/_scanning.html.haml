            Scanning - is it hard to do?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fs-1' }
          .accordion-inner
            Not at all. If you can use a printer or a photocopier, then you can use a scanner

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fs', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fs-2' }
            What kind of a scanner do I need?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fs-2' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              Any scanner that can take a bunch of sheets at a time
            %p
              The only type of scanner we do <b>not</b> recommend is what is called 
              a <b>flat-bed</b> scanner. Its the kind where you have to lift a lid, place 
              a sheet and then scan
            %p
              The problem with flat-bed scanners is that one can scan only one sheet 
              at a time. Fine for scanning 5-6 sheets. But any more, and its painful to use
              
        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fs', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fs-3' }
            Should I scan in color or black-and-white?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fs-3' }
          .accordion-inner
            Either is fine. What is more important is that the scans be clear 
            so that any handwriting on them can be read

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fs', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fs-4' }
            How do I get clear scans?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fs-4' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              Most scanners work in two broad modes - one for scanning photographs 
              and another for scanning documents
            %p
              You should scan pages in document mode - which generally means scanning at a resolution 
              of 200-300 dpi ( or dots per inch ). Don't bother with scanning as photographs (600 dpi and above).
              It would be overkill, unnecessary and slow

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fs', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fs-5' }
            After scanning, do I e-mail the scans to you?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fs-5' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              No. You only need to store the scans in a particular location on your 
              computer and we will take it from there
            %p
              That location is a folder called <b>ScanTray</b>. It is created  
              by a small application called <b>Scanbot</b> which you will need to download 
              once - and only once - onto your computer
            %p
              See next question on <b>Scanbot</b>

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fs', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fs-6' }
            What is Scanbot and why do I need it?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fs-6' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              The Scanbot is a small, downloadable utility that runs in the background 
              and takes care of transmitting any new scans from your PC to us 
            %p
              Once downloaded, Scanbot will create a special folder on your PC's Desktop 
              called - <b>ScanTray</b>. This is the only folder Scanbot will looks inside - and 
              nowhere else
            %p
              Thereafter, everytime you scan worksheets, you should ask your scanner 
              to store the scans in this folder
