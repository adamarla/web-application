            What is a Quiz?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'wb-1' }

            %p
              A quiz is nothing more than a collection of questions - with their solutions
            %p
              To make a quiz, a teacher first selects the topics she wants to cover and then picks 
              questions on the selected topics. Thereafter, she can use the quiz as a template 
              to make worksheets for students
            %p
              Please note that a quiz is made just once, but worksheets can be made anytime - and 
              as many times - afterwards. So - for example - you could make a quiz this year 
              and use it to make worksheets for your current batch of students. And next year 
              you could use the same quiz to make worksheets for that year's batch

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#wb', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#wb-2' }
            What is a Worksheet?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'wb-2' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              Just like a quiz - but with blank space after every question for students 
              to write their solution in and with some student-specific information 
              encoded on the page
            %p
              To make a worksheet, a teacher first selects a quiz from the list of quizzes she 
              has made uptil now and then selects students she wants to make worksheets for

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#wb', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#wb-3' }
            What is a Group?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'wb-3' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              A group is simply a collection of students. If you teach in a school or university environment, 
              then each class or section you teach is what we are calling a group here
            %p
              However, you can make groups different from the groups you teach in real world. For example,
              you could make a group called "Gifted Students" that includes the 4-5 best students from each of the
              sections you teach in the real world. You might want to do this because you would like to 
              give these gifted students extra work over and above their regular course work
            %p
              Please note that one student can belong to more than group

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#wb', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#wb-5' }
            I have made a quiz and it will take a couple of minutes for the PDF to get ready. Why?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'wb-5' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              A lot of work is done behind the scenes to make a quiz and it just takes the time 
              that it needs to take
            %p
              So, rather than keep you waiting for the work to finish, we take your request and put it in a queue 
              where it is processed in the order in which it came. This way, you can be left free 
              to continue using the website 
            %p
              The time your request will take to finish depends on how many requests are before it 
              in the queue and how much work your request represents. Ordinarily, however, each 
              request takes 40-60 seconds to process when its turn comes
            %p
              The same is true for worksheets too
