              A graduate of Anderson School of Management UCLA, Abhinav first 
              realized the the need for gradians.com while grading papers for his 
              statistics  professor. It occurred to him that if this was something 
              teachers had to do themselves, they could not do it very often.
              This was the genesis of the idea.
            %p
              Prior to this Abhinav was a software engineer in the semiconductor
              industry. From a young age he has cultured an avid interest in
              Computer Programming and has an inveterate curiousity in how 
              systems work.
            %p
              He is also good at racquet sports.
