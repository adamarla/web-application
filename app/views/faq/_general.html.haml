            Grading is tedious work. Why are you offering to do it?

            What subjects do you cover?

              We are starting with Mathematics. And  going forward, we could extend the system  
              to cover the other sciences - like Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science etc. 
            %p
              Social sciences are tricky though. We are not sure whether a History teacher - for example - 
              would agree with our assessment of her student's work. That is not a problem with 
              the sciences though because what is scientifically sound in one place is scientifically 
              sound everywhere else too
