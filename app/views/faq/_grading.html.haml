            What subjects do you cover?

          .accordion-inner
            We are starting with Mathematics. But going forward, we intend to cover 
            other science subjects - like Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science etc.

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fgr', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fgr-2' }
            I know my students and I grade accordingly. Why should I trust your grading?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fgr-2' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              True. We do not know your students and its unlikely we will ever
              know them personally
            %p
              But we do know maths and science. And what is mathematically and scientifically 
              sound in one country is mathematically and scientifically sound everywhere else
              in the world
            %p
              All that we offer, therefore, is an impartial assessment of a student's work. 
              And more than the grades, we hope it is the feedback we give that students will use 
              as a basis for further study, discussion and improvement

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fgr', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fgr-3' }
            Who does the grading?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fgr-3' }
          .accordion-inner
            Our engineers do. All of them have university degrees in engineering and therefore 
            know something about maths and science

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fgr', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fgr-4' }
            Do your graders give marks?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fgr-4' }
          .accordion-inner
            Not directly. For each question, our graders give structured and free-flowing 
            feedback that the syetem then uses to calculate a numerical score. If two 
            students get the same feedback, then they will get the same score - irrespective 
            of who the graders were

        .accordion-heading
          %a.accordion-toggle{ :data => { :parent => '#fgr', :toggle => 'collapse' }, :href => '#fgr-5' }
            How long would it take to grade an assigment?
        .accordion-body.collapse{ :id => 'fgr-5' }
          .accordion-inner
            %p
              If the work of all students has been scanned together and sent in one set, then 
              we aim to have it graded within three (3) working days
            %p
              When graded, teachers and students will get an e-mail to let them know that 
              results can now be seen
