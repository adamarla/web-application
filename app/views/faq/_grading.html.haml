  %h1.white= "Questions on grading" 
  .span5
    %p.question= "What subjects do you cover?" 
    %p
      We are starting with Mathematics. But going forward, we intend to cover 
      other science subjects - like Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science etc.
    %p.question= "I know my students and I grade accordingly. Why should I trust your grading?"
    %p
      True. We do not know your students and its unlikely we will ever
      know them personally
    %p
      But we do know maths and science. And what is mathematically and scientifically 
      sound in one country is mathematically and scientifically sound everywhere else
      in the world
    %p
      All that we offer, therefore, is an impartial assessment of a student's work. 
      And more than the grades, we hope it is the feedback we give that students will use 
      as a basis for further study, discussion and improvement
  .span5.offset1
    %p.question= "Who does the grading?"
    %p
      Our engineers do. All of them have university degrees in engineering and therefore 
      know something about maths and science
    %p.question= "Do your graders give marks?"
    %p
      Not directly. For each question, our graders give structured and free-flowing 
      feedback that the syetem then uses to calculate a numerical score. If two 
      students get the same feedback, then they will get the same score - irrespective 
      of who the graders were
    %p.question= "How long would it take to grade an assignment?"
    %p
      If the work of all students has been scanned together and sent in one set, then 
      we aim to have it graded within three (3) working days
    %p
      When graded, teachers and students will get an e-mail to let them know that 
      results can now be seen
