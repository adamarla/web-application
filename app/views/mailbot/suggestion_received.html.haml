  Dear #{@teacher.first_name},
%p
  We have received the questions you sent today for inclusion into the database.
  And we expect to have them added by #{@deadline.strftime('%I:%M%p GMT')} on 
  #{@deadline.strftime('%A, %b %d')}
%p
  Please know that we take great care before adding a question into our database. 
  For example, we create <b>multiple versions</b> for every question you send. And as far 
  as possible, <b>we try to ensure</b> that each new question brings with it <b>new insights</b>
  for the student
%p
  Our aim is to keep the noise as low in our question bank. And therefore, if we feel that 
  some of the questions you sent today are similar to the ones we already have <b>or</b> if 
  we feel they do not offer any new insights, then we would decide against typesetting them. 
%p
  We just thought you should know how we work lest you fail to find the exact questions 
  you sent when you next check
%p
  Best regards, 
  <b>Gradians Support Team</b>
