  Hello #{@student.first_name},
%p
  This is to let you know that your work on <b>#{@quiz.name}</b> by your teacher 
  <b>#{@quiz.teacher.name}</b> has been graded
%p
  You can now login into your account - using the e-mail and password you provided - 
  to view our feedback on your work
%h3= "The Grading Process"
%p
  You might have questions on how we grade and what we look for in the work you do.
  So, let us tell you now
%p
  When we grade your assignments, we ask ourselves the following questions
  %ul
    %li
      <b>Is the work done the student's own?</b>When something has been plagiarised, it shows. 
      We like to see you making your own mistakes - not someone else's
    %li
      <b>Is the work mathematically sound?</b> Which means, has the student identified the key 
      to solving the problem and followed it up with mathematical work 
    %li
      <b>Does the solution make for a cogent story?</b> In other words, if one were 
      to read the solution from start to finish, could one easily see what you (the student) 
      were thinking
%p
  Other than these, we do not care for much else - least of all the final answer. 
  If you understand the underlying Math, you will eventually get to the answer

%h3="Where can I see my scores?"
%p
  You can't - because we do not show them to you. Your teacher, however, can. And if you really 
  must know, you can always ask him/her. That said, we do hope you will resist the urge
%p
  And here is why. Our aim is not to rank order you. Nor should you rank order yourself - which 
  you would be able to do if you knew your scores and those of your friends
%p  
  Rather, our aim is to help you relax about Maths (its possible) and to use our feedback 
  to improve. As we like to say at Gradians.com - <b>Grades will happen</b>. And they will.
  Take it from people who were once in school just like you 
%p
  With best wishes,
%p
  <b>The Gradians.com Team</b>
