  -# We need a buffer layer between here and the element on which 
  -# jQuery.accordion() will be called. Otherwise, the attributes
  -# .accordion() sets on the element will interfere with accordion 
  -# rendering in subsequent runs. Therefore, we have .samurai-garrison.
  -# Within it would be .samurai-armory (added in JS) and within that 
  -# would be .samurai-swords
