// The recommended practice is not to include any JS code 
// in a manifest file - like this one. Instead, split JS code 
// in other .js files and require them as needed

//= require jquery 
//= require jquery_ujs 
//= require bootstrap 
//= require_directory ../../../vendor/assets/javascripts/popeye 
//= require_directory ./core
//= require_directory ../../../vendor/assets/javascripts/happy
