// The recommended practice is not to include any JS code 
// in a manifest file - like this one. Instead, split JS code 
// in other .js files and require them as needed

//= require jquery.ui.autocomplete 
//= require jquery.ui.effect-blind
//= require_directory ./shared/ad-ex
//= require_directory ./shared/ad-ex-tc
//= require_directory ./admin 
//= require_directory ./customers
//= require_directory ../../../vendor/assets/javascripts/tag-it
//= require_directory ../../../vendor/assets/javascripts/tooltipster
//= require_directory ../../../vendor/assets/javascripts/uploader
