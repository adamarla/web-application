Each sub-folder here started out first in the preview area. 
There, it was kind of sandbox in which teachers could add / drop 
questions from the question paper. 

Once here, the same folder represents the teachers final selection
that needs to be now converted into a pair of composite documents
ready for printout and / or download. The first is the question 
paper ( with student specific QR codes ). The second is the 
auto-generated answer key
