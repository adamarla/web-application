This folder contains dummy files that serve(d?) as proxies for 
a DB in the early stages of development. 

As I was not sure how things would stitch together, I started 
build in a bottom-up manner, that is, developed the backend 
before the front-end ( website ) to test some basic assumptions 
about how customized LaTeX documents could be generated on the fly

This meant that in the initial stages, I was working without a 
a DB. And yet, I needed data to run my code over. So, I created
proxy files on which to test the code - knowing full well that
whilst the essence of the code being written will remain, 
some details might change

This folder should have *no* use when we go into production. But 
that's just my guess at this time
