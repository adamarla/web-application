The sub-folders of this folder represent live, on-going 
sessions. 

Each sub-folder starts with an initial question selection made 
for the teacher. The teacher can then modify this selection
by adding or dropping questions. She can also select the students
for whom the question paper is to be made. By default, we assume
that the question paper is to be made for the whole class.

Once done, the sub-folder is moved (copied?) to the staging area.
The sub-folder now represents the teachers final selection
and we can now proceed with creating a composite document 
with student specific QR codes for each question
